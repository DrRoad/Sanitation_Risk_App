# Sanitation_Risk_App
Gather's Online Application for Viewing Sanitation Risk in CUA5, funded by the World Bank.

This is based on an initial application template by Luis Rodrigues, but changed for a new deliverable for the World Bank. 

# General 
There are three main outputs. 
The home tab introduces the application. 
The risk tab shows the Sanitation Risk Index final values. Indicating areas where an individual in a community is most likely to come in contact with fecal waste. 
The Data Sources is a drop down, showing Environment, Social and Value Chain Datasets. The risk index was based off Dr. Luiza Campos (2015) > https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247815595784
